## Quotes


>> Rob Pike's 5 Rules:
>> 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. \
>>    Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, \
>>    so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack, \
>>    until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is. 
>> 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, \
>>    and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest. 
>> 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. \
>>    Fancy algorithms have big constants. \
>>    Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. \
>>    (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) 
>> 4. **Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, \
>>    and they're much harder to implement. \
>>    Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.** 
>> 5. Data dominates. \
>>    If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, \
>>    the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. \
>>    Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

> Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as "When in doubt, use brute force.". \
> Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design philosophy KISS. \
> Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. \
> Rule 5 is often shortened to "write stupid code that uses smart objects". \
