## Quotes

> The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.

>> Rob Pike's 5 Rules:
>> 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. \
>>    Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, \
>>    so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack, \
>>    until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is. 
>> 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, \
>>    and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest. 
>> 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. \
>>    Fancy algorithms have big constants. \
>>    Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. \
>>    (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) 
>> 4. **Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, \
>>    and they're much harder to implement. \
>>    Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.** 
>> 5. Data dominates. \
>>    If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, \
>>    the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. \
>>    Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

> Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." \
> Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as "When in doubt, use brute force.". \
> Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design philosophy KISS. \
> Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. \
> Rule 5 is often shortened to "write stupid code that uses smart objects". \

> Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around. \
> ~ Eric S. Raymond, The Cathedral and The Bazaar

> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, \
> but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. \
> ~ Edsger W. Dijkstra, "The Humble Programmer" (1972)

> Refactoring provides enough energy to a system for it to relax into a new and more comfortable state, \
> a new local minimum. \
> ~ Kevlin Henney, "The Imperial Clothing Crisis" (2002)

> Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. \
> Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity. \
> ~ David Gelernter, "Machine Beauty", Basic Books (1998)

> Fools ignore complexity; \
> pragmatists suffer it; \
> experts avoid it; \
> geniuses remove it. \
> ~ Alan Perlis

> There are two ways of constructing a software design. \
> One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. \
> And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. \
> ~ C.A.R. Hoare

> If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, \
> you are not ready to code it. \
> ~ Richard E. Pattis

> Testing by itself does not improve software quality. \
> Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. \
> Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. \
> What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, \
> and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. \
> If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. \
> If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better. \
> ~ Steve McConnell, "Code Complete"

> Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: \
> they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, \
> because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. \
> A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code. \
> ~ Eric S. Raymond

Some comic relief:

> The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, \
> most experts agree, is by accident. \
> That's where we come in; we're computer professionals. \
> We cause accidents. \
> ~ Nathaniel S. Borenstein

> Computer Science is the only discipline in which we view adding a new wing to a building as being maintenance. \
> ~ Jim Horning
